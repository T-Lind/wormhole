# Wormhole Simulation - Development Progress

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### ✅ Completed

**Phase 1: Basic Scene Rendering**
- [x] Two distinct scenes created
  - **Scene 1 (Left, z < 0)**: Spheres with RGB colors (Red, Green, Blue, Orange)
  - **Scene 2 (Right, z > 0)**: Cubes with CMY colors (Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, White)
- [x] Ray-sphere intersection (with normals)
- [x] Ray-cube intersection (AABB with proper normals)
- [x] Camera system (orbit & zoom)
- [x] Simple diffuse lighting
- [x] **OpenMP parallelization** (multi-threaded rendering)
- [x] Central marker sphere (blue) at origin (wormhole placeholder)

### Performance Improvements
- **OpenMP**: Multi-core CPU usage (should be 2-8x faster depending on CPU cores)
- **Expected FPS**: 5-15 FPS (was 0.2-5 before)
- **Rendering**: Parallel ray tracing across all CPU cores

## Next Steps: Wormhole Connection

### Phase 2: Portal Effect (Simple) 🔄
**Goal**: Make it look like scenes are connected through a portal

1. **Add portal visualization**
   - Ring or disk at z = 0 (wormhole throat)
   - Glowing edge effect
   - Transparent center

2. **Ray redirection**
   - When ray hits portal, redirect to other scene
   - Map left → right and right → left
   - Simple coordinate flip initially

3. **Distortion near portal**
   - Bend rays near the portal edges
   - Create fisheye/lens effect
   - Gradual transition

**Expected Result**: Can see Scene 2 (cubes) when looking through portal from Scene 1 side

---

### Phase 3: Gravitational Lensing 🔄
**Goal**: Add realistic light bending

1. **Distance-based ray bending**
   - Rays closer to portal bend more
   - Use simplified gravitational field
   - Impact parameter b determines deflection

2. **Multiple ray paths**
   - Primary image (straight through)
   - Secondary images (bent around)
   - Einstein ring effect

3. **Smooth transitions**
   - Gradual bending region
   - No hard boundaries
   - Physically motivated curves

**Expected Result**: Objects appear distorted near portal, Einstein ring visible

### Phase 4: Full Wormhole Physics 🔄
**Goal**: Implement Morris-Thorne metric

1. **Coordinate system**
   - Switch to cylindrical (l, ρ, φ)
   - Proper distance l along throat axis
   - Radial distance ρ from axis

2. **Geodesic equations**
   - RK4 integration
   - Morris-Thorne metric: ds² = -c²dt² + dl² + (b₀² + l²)(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
   - Track universe transitions

3. **Shape function**
   - r(l) = √(b₀² + l²)
   - Throat radius b₀
   - Smooth connection

**Expected Result**: Physically accurate wormhole with exact GR equations

## Design Decisions

### Scene Layout
```
        Scene 1 (Spheres)          Portal         Scene 2 (Cubes)
              RGB                    (0,0,0)              CMY
        
    Red •                             ⭘                    ◼ Yellow
  Green •        ← looking from    [throat]    looking →  ◼ Magenta  
   Blue •           this side                  from here   ◼ Cyan
 Orange •                                                  ◼ White
   
      z < 0                          z = 0              z > 0
```

### Why This Approach?

1. **Two scenes**: Clear visual distinction (spheres vs cubes, RGB vs CMY)
2. **Spatial separation**: Easier to debug - can see which scene you're in
3. **Incremental complexity**: Start simple, add physics gradually
4. **Visual clarity**: Different shapes make portal effect obvious

## Performance Targets

| Phase | Target FPS | Complexity |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Phase 1 (Current) | 5-15 | Simple ray tracing |
| Phase 2 (Portal) | 3-10 | Ray redirection |
| Phase 3 (Lensing) | 1-5 | Multiple ray paths |
| Phase 4 (Full GR) | 0.5-2 | Geodesic integration |

With OpenMP, we're getting good performance!

## Technical Notes

### Current Ray Tracing
```cpp
Ray → Scene objects → Hit test → Shade → Display
```

### Phase 2 Will Add
```cpp
Ray → Portal check → 
  If hits portal: Redirect to other scene
  Else: Normal scene intersection
```

### Phase 3 Will Add
```cpp
Ray → Bend near portal → 
  Multiple curved paths →
  Test all scenes → 
  Combine results
```

### Phase 4 Will Add
```cpp
Ray → RK4 integration →
  Follow geodesic →
  Universe transitions →
  Scene intersection →
  Physical accuracy
```
